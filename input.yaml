# Figaro expects all sequences to be of the same length, so cutting all sequences to a specific length is needed.
# This simplifies the Figaro analyses, and it helps remove sequences not expected to give you a meaningful hit to DADA2
# You can write a specific number you like (eg 100, for 100 basepairs), or, you can filter out sequences based on general parameters as below
# Default: is that if the length of sequences in Q1 is within 10% of Q2 (median), then use the Q1 to include the majority of sequences. Otherwise Q2 is used
# Q1: 25th percentile length
# Q2: 50th percentile length (median) 
# Q3: 75th percentile length
# max_len: longest sequence length
# This only accepts one value only. So if you have more than 1 uncommented, only the first one will be used0
